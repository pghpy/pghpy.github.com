        <h2>Anti-harassment policy</h2>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Pittsburgh Python User Group is dedicated to providing a
          safe and welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of
          gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
          disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
          religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in
          any form.</p>

        <p>This code of conduct applies to all Pittsburgh Python
          spaces, including our meetings, mailing lists and IRC
          channel. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be
          sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion
          of the organizers.</p>

        <p>Some meeting venue may have additional rules in place,
          which will be made clearly available to
          participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and
          abiding by these rules.</p>

        <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>Harassment includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity
            and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental
            illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body
            size, race, or religion</li>
          <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle
            choices and practices, including those related to food,
            health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
          <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected
            names</li>
          <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in
            spaces where they’re not appropriate</li>
          <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg,
            textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without
            consent or after a request to stop.</li>
          <li>Threats of violence</li>
          <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including
            encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in
            self-harm</li>
          <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
          <li>Stalking or following</li>
          <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging
            online activity for harassment purposes</li>
          <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
          <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as
            requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with
            others</li>
          <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to
            cease</li>
          <li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity
            without their consent except as necessary to protect
            vulnerable people from intentional abuse</li>
          <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Pittsburgh Python prioritizes marginalized people’s safety
          over privileged people’s comfort. The organizers will not
          act on complaints regarding:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse
            sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’</li>
          <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave
            me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with
            you.”</li>
          <li>Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>
          <li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise
            oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reporting</h3>
        <p>If you are being harassed by a member of Pittsburgh Python,
          notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any
          other concerns, please contact the organizers at
          <a href="mailto:organizers@pghpython.org">organizers@pghpython.org</a>
          If the person who is harassing you is an organizer, they
          will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will
          respond as promptly as we can.</p>

        <p>This code of conduct applies to Pittsburgh Python spaces,
          but if you are being harassed by a member of Pittsburgh
          Python outside our spaces, we still want to know about
          it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by
          Pittsburgh Python members, especially the
          <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pghpython/members/?op=leaders">
          leadership team</a>, seriously. This includes harassment
          outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any
          point in time. We reserve the right to exclude people from
          Pittsburgh Python based on their past behavior, including
          behavior outside Pittsburgh Python spaces and behavior
          towards people who are not in Pittsburgh Python.</p>

        <p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we
          reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have
          been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence
          legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

        <p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of
          protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may
          publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment
          complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if
          we believe that doing so will increase the safety of
          Pittsburgh Python members or the general public. We will not
          name harassment victims without their affirmative
          consent.</p>

        <h3>Consequences</h3>
        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
          expected to comply immediately.</p>

        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, we may take
          any action we deem appropriate, up to and including
          expulsion from all Pittsburgh Python spaces and
          identification of the participant as a harasser to other
          Pittsburgh Python members or the general public.</p>
